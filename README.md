# carpenTREE
repo for carpentries lesson visualization

## Backgroud

This is a hackday project created at the #CollabW19 workshop in Loughborough on 3 April 2019. 

We aim to address the following use cases:

As a carpentry instructor, 
I want to create a customised lesson for a specific outcome 
In order to deliver efficient and tailored training.

As a carpentries student
I want to know which lessons would be a good follow up to what I just learned
In order to get the most out of the software carpentries class and material.

## Idea
The idea is to scrape software carpentries lessons for learning outcomes and prerequisites and visualize them in an interactive tree structure that helps navigating episodes within software carpentry lessons. A manual prototype is available [on the TeSS ELIXIR portal](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/workflows/carpentree-test-case/).

## Implementation

### Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run with:

`python fertilizer.py'
